Intronic variants in SLCO1B1 related to statin-induced myopathy are associated with the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to statins in Chinese patients with hyperlipidaemia.
Whole-genome studies have identified several intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SLCO1B1 associated with simvastatin-induced myopathy. The present study determined the effect of an intronic SNP rs4149081 in SLCO1B1 on the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin and rosuvastatin in Chinese patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Lipid profiles were determined off treatment and after at least 4 weeks of treatment with each of the statins at daily doses of rosuvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 40 mg. In 247 patients with good adherence, the rs4149081 G>A polymorphism was significantly associated with a 4.6 and 4.0% greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction compared with those with wild-type alleles in response to rosuvastatin and simvastatin, respectively (P<0.05 for both). The 388A>G and 521T>C polymorphisms were not associated with the LDL-C response to either statin. The intronic SNP rs4149081 in SLCO1B1 was associated with the LDL-C response to statins in Chinese patients and this association was independent of the 521T>C polymorphism.
