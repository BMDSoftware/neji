Accuracy of various human NAT2 SNP genotyping panels to infer rapid, intermediate and slow acetylator phenotypes.
Humans exhibit genetic polymorphism in NAT2 resulting in rapid, intermediate and slow acetylator phenotypes. Over 65 NAT2 variants possessing one or more SNPs in the 870-bp NAT2 coding region have been reported. The seven most frequent SNPs are rs1801279 (191G>A), rs1041983 (282C>T), rs1801280 (341T>C), rs1799929 (481C>T), rs1799930 (590G>A), rs1208 (803A>G) and rs1799931 (857G>A). The majority of studies investigate the NAT2 genotype assay for three SNPs: 481C>T, 590G>A and 857G>A. A tag-SNP (rs1495741) recently identified in a genome-wide association study has also been proposed as a biomarker for the NAT2 phenotype.
Sulfamethazine N-acetyltransferase catalytic activities were measured in cryopreserved human hepatocytes from a convenience sample of individuals in the USA with an ethnic frequency similar to the 2010 US population census. These activities were segregated by the tag-SNP rs1495741 and each of the seven SNPs described above. We assessed the accuracy of the tag-SNP and various two-, three-, four- and seven-SNP genotyping panels for their ability to accurately infer NAT2 phenotype.
The accuracy of the various NAT2 SNP genotype panels to infer NAT2 phenotype were as follows: seven-SNP: 98.4%; tag-SNP: 77.7%; two-SNP: 96.1%; three-SNP: 92.2%; and four-SNP: 98.4%.
A NAT2 four-SNP genotype panel of rs1801279 (191G>A), rs1801280 (341T>C), rs1799930 (590G>A) and rs1799931 (857G>A) infers NAT2 acetylator phenotype with high accuracy, and is recommended over the tag-, two-, three- and (for economy of scale) the seven-SNP genotyping panels, particularly in populations of non-European ancestry.
