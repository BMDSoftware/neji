UGT2B7 genetic polymorphisms are associated with the withdrawal symptoms in methadone maintenance patients.
To test whether the genetic polymorphisms within the gene encoding the UGT2B7 gene may have an impact on methadone treatment.
Twelve SNPs in UGT2B7 were selected. 366 methadone maintenance treatment patients in Taiwan were recruited and genotyped.
In a genotype recessive model, rs6600879, rs6600880, rs4554144, rs11940316, rs7438135, rs7662029, rs7668258, rs7439366, rs4292394 and rs6600893 showed significant associations with severity of withdrawal symptoms (permutation p < 0.002), pupil size (permutation p < 0.048) and tremor (permutation p < 0.008). Haplotypes of GATCAGCCGC and CTCTGATTCT were significantly associated with pupil size score and tremor score (p < 0.034).
These results suggest that SNPs of the UGT2B7 gene may play important roles in opiate withdrawal symptoms.
