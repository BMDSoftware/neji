Neji is a flexible and powerful platform for biomedical information extraction from scientific texts, such as patents, publications and electronic health records.

### Gimli is now part of Neji
Gimli is now easier to use with faster training and processing times. Its functionalities are now integrated into Neji, providing the same high accuracy previously achieved.
Now you can use Neji to train machine learning models to perform NER, and integrate them in complex processing pipelines to annotate millions of documents with dozens of heterogenous entity types.

## Tasks
Neji can be used for various text mining tasks:

- **Concept recognition:**
    - Dictionary-based, Machine learning-based and Rule-based
- **Train machine learning models for NER (Named Entity Recognition):**
	- Normalization with dictionary matching and Stopword filtering
- **Linguistic parsing:**
    - Sentence splitting, Tokenisation, Lemmatisation, Chunking and Dependency parsing
- **Convert between corpora formats:**
	- **Input formats:** BioC, XML, HTML and Text 
	- **Output formats:** JSON, A1, BC2, Base64, BioC, CoNLL, IeXML, Pipe and PipeExtended

## Quick start
1. Download and extract the [latest version of Neji](https://github.com/BMDSoftware/neji/releases/download/v2.0.0/neji-2.0.0.zip)
2. Use `neji.sh` to annotate
3. Use `nejiTrain.sh` to train new NER models


## Documentation
