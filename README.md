## What is new in Neji 2?
- Gimli for machine learning NER training
- Multiple linguistic parsers support, for general text and multi-language
- Support to additional input and output formats, including BioC
- SDK usability improvements
- Performance improvements
- Stability improvements


## Quick start
1. Download and extract the [latest version of Neji](https://github.com/BMDSoftware/neji/releases/download/v2.0.0/neji-2.0.0.zip)
2. Use `neji.sh` to annotate
3. Use `nejiTrain.sh` to train new NER models


## Tasks
Neji can be used for various text mining tasks:

- **Concept recognition:**
    - Dictionary-based, Machine learning-based and Rule-based
- **Train machine learning models for NER (Named Entity Recognition):**
	- Normalization with dictionary matching and Stopword filtering
- **Linguistic parsing:**
    - Sentence splitting, Tokenisation, Lemmatisation, Chunking and Dependency parsing
- **Convert between corpora formats:**
	- **Input formats:** BioC, XML, HTML and Text 
	- **Output formats:** JSON, A1, BC2, Base64, BioC, CoNLL, IeXML, Pipe and PipeExtended
